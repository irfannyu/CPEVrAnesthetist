Our project hopes to develop a training simulation for local anesthesia administration in an average human male, based on three crucial parameters :  
measuring the angle and depth of insertion of syringe and amount of anesthesia to be administered, inorder to provide the user (primary target audience: medical students and practitioners) a virtual environment to learn through guided experiences in safe contexts, facilitating adequate learning and standardized assessment of the skills necessary to face a changing world. 


The workings of the project are as described below:

⚫Softwares Required: Unity Game Engine, C#

⚫Hardwares Required: Oculus MetaQuest 2 Headset

⚫Additional Assets Used:
Oculus Integration (by Oculus) 
3D Free Modular Kit (by Barking Dog)
Hospital Bed- Free 3D Asset (by Cobble Games)
Character- Idle on CH01_NONBPR (by Mixamo)

## 📝Lessons Learned
✨Through this project, we were introduced to concepts and processes for design and creation of virtual 3D spaces for wide-ranging and changing purposes using the Unity 3D engine, one of the most popular and efficient game development platforms.

✨We designed and created an interactive, immersive 3D simulation for anesthesia administration based on two important parameters using  Unity add specifics

✨Basic scripting in C# and coverting a pseudocode into a VR simulation

✨We thrived as a team and learnt how to collaborate and distribute the work according to our expertise and availability, achieve team deadlines and in turn, learn something new together and bonding over it.
